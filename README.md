## [Microsoft Research : Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Riqjdh2oM)


 > This talk discards hand-wavy pop-science metaphors and answers a simple question: from a computer science perspective, how can a quantum computer outperform a classical computer? Attendees will learn the following:

Representing computation with basic linear algebra (matrices and vectors)
The computational workings of qbits, superposition, and quantum logic gates
Solving the Deutsch oracle problem: the simplest problem where a quantum computer outperforms classical methods
Bonus topics: quantum entanglement and teleportation
The talk concludes with a live demonstration of quantum entanglement on a real-world quantum computer, and a demo of the Deutsch oracle problem implemented in Q# with the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit. This talk assumes no prerequisite knowledge, although comfort with basic linear algebra (matrices, vectors, matrix multiplication) will ease understanding.
